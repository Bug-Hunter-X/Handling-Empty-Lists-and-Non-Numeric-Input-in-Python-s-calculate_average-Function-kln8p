This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError that can occur when calculating the average of an empty list.  The original code lacks proper error handling. The solution provides a more robust function that addresses both the empty list scenario and the possibility of non-numeric input, preventing unexpected errors.
